# Rule Suggestions Cursor Rules

When working with this codebase, actively observe patterns, repetitive actions, common issues, and developer preferences that could benefit from codified rules.

## When to Suggest New Rules

Suggest creating a new cursor rules file when you notice:

- Repetitive patterns in code structure, naming conventions, or file organization
- Consistent user preferences that deviate from defaults (e.g., specific formatting, patterns, or architectural decisions)
- Common mistakes or issues that could be prevented with guidance
- Domain-specific conventions that would help maintain consistency
- Integration patterns or tool-specific requirements that should be documented

## When to Suggest Rule Updates

Suggest updating existing rules when you notice:

- The user's actions consistently differ from what existing rules specify
- Rules are outdated or no longer reflect current practices
- Additional guidance would be valuable based on patterns you observe
- Rules could be improved with examples, clarification, or additional categories
- Rules are vague or unclear and should be made more specific

## How to Present Suggestions

When suggesting rule improvements:

1. **Be Proactive**: Present suggestions during or after completing tasks when you've observed relevant patterns
2. **Be Specific**: Include concrete examples from the codebase to illustrate why the rule would be valuable
3. **Be Clear**: Explain the benefit and scope of the suggested rule
4. **Provide Options**: Offer to create a new rules file or update an existing one, and suggest appropriate file names
5. **Include Context**: Reference specific files, patterns, or decisions that led to the suggestion

## Rule File Naming

- Use descriptive, kebab-case names (e.g., `terraform.mdc`, `flux.mdc`, `secrets.mdc`)
- Group related rules logically - use separate files for distinct domains
- Consider `general.mdc` for broad, project-wide rules

## Example Suggestion Format

When making a suggestion, you might say:

"I've noticed that you consistently [specific pattern]. This suggests creating a rule to [benefit]. Would you like me to:

1. Create a new rules file at `.cursor/rules/[name].mdc` with [description]
2. Add this guidance to the existing `.cursor/rules/[name].mdc` file

This would help ensure future code follows this pattern automatically."

## Balance

- Don't over-suggest: Only propose rules when there's clear value and a consistent pattern
- Respect existing rules: Don't suggest changes unless there's evidence they should be updated
- Consider scope: Ensure suggested rules are specific enough to be actionable but general enough to be useful
